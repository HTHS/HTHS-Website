<p>
	The High Technology High School community is now engaged in the process of Accreditation for Growth (AFG) as established by the Middle States Association (MSA). This is an exciting challenge that uses strategic planning as a vehicle for school improvement and growth in student performance. To implement this procedure, representatives from various stakeholder groups have been assembled to assist: staff, administration, students, parents, community and business leaders. These stakeholders work together to identify areas in need of improvement, design action plans to address these concerns, and develop methods to measure progress. Once the self-study and planning process is completed, a validation team visit is scheduled to assure that the objectives are addressed and the MSA standards are met. At the end of the visit, the validation team chair gives an oral report that highlights the team&#39;s findings. A team written report, which includes commendations and recommendations, is sent at a later date. AFG is a continuous seven-year process, during which time the school must annually self-evaluate how it achieves the objectives set forth in the strategic plan. At the midpoint of the seven-year accreditation timeline, the school takes part in a second validation team visit, which is used to ensure that the plan is actively being implemented. As part of AFG procedure, the community is continuously kept informed of the process. This web page serves as a community outreach and describes tasks that are in progress and those that lie ahead.</p>
