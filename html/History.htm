	High Technology High School opened for the first time in September, 1991. It is a collaborative venture of the Monmouth County Vocational School District Board of Education and the Brookdale Community College Board of Trustees. At first, the school was planned to educate students in grades 10 - 12. All students had to apply in their freshman (9th grade) year of high school, and only 60 students were accepted per class as sophomores. In 1995, we began educating students in the 9th grade as well. In order to keep the school size around 240, class sizes will be &quot;capped&quot; at about 65 students per class. This will ensure that all students will be able to receive equal attention from school faculty. During our first year, construction of the high school building was still taking place, so our classes were held in the basement of the adjacent college building. We moved into our own building in 1992. Our building has had two expansions since its initial construction. The first addition, in 1994-95, more than doubled the size of the school in all ways. The latest expansion in 2002 includes a new CAD lab, presentation space, faculty offices, and long term storage areas for ongoing research projects in a variety of subject areas.</p>
